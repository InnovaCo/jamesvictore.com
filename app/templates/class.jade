			.block__paragraph__title about the class 

			p To be radical is to set yourself apart—to reject all the rules. Legendary designer James Victore shows us how to distill our most passionate ideas to a typography-based poster that represents our voices to the world. It’s an hour where we’ll disregard the rules, pay homage to iconic misfits and artists, discover James’s favorite tools, and find freedom in graphic play. What do you have to say?

				| “ Great class! James Victore is very inspiring, he pushes you to step outside your comfort zone — and for good reason. He urges you to forget about the rules, forget about what’s taught, forget about mass media. This class gives you something to think about.”

				| “ Highly excellent! The course gives a practical look at how James makes some of his work, but in a way that encourages you to get weird and be yourself in your work, not emulate his. Realizing that constantly “playing” needs to be part of my process is one of the biggest things that will stick with me.”

				| “ James Victore gives great insight to his process.There are historical references, and excellent suggestions for tools and surfaces. Most importantly, the student is encouraged to let loose, and PLAY. As a designer I’m always working with grids and checking kerning and leading and this class was a great way to get away from those restrictions and just make marks.”
