				| “ Most with the motto ‘badass’ end up rock stars, porn stars or thrill-seeking rebels. The particular charm of graphic designer James Victore is that he’s all of these things; with his repertoire of heartfelt slogans and self-taught illustrations, he has succeeded in changing the way the world views commercial art and even better – the way people view the world.”
