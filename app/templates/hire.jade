				p.text James speaks to audiences worldwide about his experiences in business, design, and what it takes to make work that matters and lead a creative life. His talks are inspiring, entertaining, highly educational, and carry huge impact.

				p.text As a designer, James has traveled the world over, seen his posters hanging on the wall at the MoMA, raced motocross, dined with giants, surfed with farmers, voiced his opinion, and has crazy stories to tell about wild failures and beautiful successes. 

				p.text His talks are replete with humor, sex appeal, truth, provocation and motivation. James teaches audiences about why it’s important to love what you do; why having a life filled with purpose matters both to you and your bottom line; why trust wins; why authenticity speaks louder than advertising; and why your personal greatness is the best gift you can give to the world. James helps people find their voice and reclaim freedom in their work and life.
