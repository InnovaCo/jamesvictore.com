					<p class="text">We started The Dinner Series in the fall of 2011 with the intention of creating the craziest (and fun-est) party/workshop we could come up with. Three years and five Dinners later, we are still holding fast to that truth.</p>
					<p class="text">The Dinner Series is four days and nights chock-full of creation, communion, deep thought, and play. An intense and intimate mastery program for conscious creatives who are ready to see and be seen.</p>
					<div class="block__paragraph__title">Days in the Studio</div>
					<p class="text">We spend our studio time working through big ideas, manipulating clichés, and searching for deeper meaning. The focus is not how to “design,” but how to think. How to seek the truth in our images, in our work and in ourselves. And how to have an
						opinion and use it to make work that is sticky, ripe with meaning, and capable of changing the world.</p>
					<p class="text">We question how we work and why we work– discussing what it actually means to be “successful.” We talk about the importance of being open to new possibilities– helping each other, and learning from each other.</p>

					<p class="text">As a studio, we are keenly aware of the liberating power of breaking bread, engaging in good conversation, and encouraging the expansion of our circle of friends. During the Dinner Series this is exactly what we try to emulate for our guests. We
						all take a moment to dress it up, meet an amazing stranger, and delight in the blissful sensory experience of really fresh, really good food. Oh, and don’t forget the bubbly.</p>
					<p class="text">There is something magical that happens when we step outside of the studio and into the realm of the muse (i.e.. Dinner). Our shoulders relax, our laughter comes out of hiding, jokes and stories start getting told, and all of the sudden – Bam! We
						free ourselves up to ground-breaking genius.</p><a href="subscribe.html" class="block__link">Join the mailing list for Dinner 2015</a>

						of the best consecutive dinners of my life. Seriously, the food was insanely good and the guests were cool as hell, especially considering many of them are freaking luminaries. I’m not a designer and because of the dinner series I’m now a better

						good cheer, hearty meals and the rarefied wisdom of talented and ambitious company. I left galvanized, with new friends and the voice in my head making a list of demands of myself and my world, saying ‘howdy’ and air boxing a whole heap. I haven’t
